%Seeking a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer related position to aid in the processing and analysis of data with the goal of delivering data-driven solutions. I am a disciplined student and tenacious learner with a background in Applied Mathematics. In my professional life Iâ€™ve held a blurred role between Python software developer, data engineer, and data scientist. I look for ways Python can improve my life while working with data to discover data-driven directions towards success.
A team of other disciplined students and tenacious learners who look for ways to improve their lives through automation and love working with data to make data-driven value-added decisions.
