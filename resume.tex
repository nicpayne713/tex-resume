%% If you want to use \orcid or the

%% to the \documentclass options.
%% Then compile with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
% \documentclass[10pt,a4paper,academicons]{altacv}

%% Use the "normalphoto" option if you want a normal photo instead of cropped to a circle
% \documentclass[10pt,a4paper,normalphoto]{altacv}

\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{altacv}

%% AltaCV uses the fontawesome and academicon fonts
%% and packages.
%% See texdoc.net/pkg/fontawecome and http://texdoc.net/pkg/academicons for full list of symbols.
%% When using the "academicons" option,
%% Compile with LuaLaTeX for best results. If you
%% want to use XeLaTeX, you may need to install
%% Academicons.ttf in your operating system's font %% folder.


% Change the page layout if you need to
\geometry{left=1cm,right=9cm,marginparwidth=6.8cm,marginparsep=1.2cm,top=1cm,bottom=1cm}

% Change the font if you want to.

% If using pdflatex:
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[default]{lato}

% If using xelatex or lualatex:
% \setmainfont{Lato}

% Change the colours if you want to

\definecolor{LightGrey}{HTML}{666666}
\colorlet{heading}{VividPurple}
\colorlet{accent}{VividPurple}
\colorlet{emphasis}{SlateGrey}
\colorlet{body}{LightGrey}

% Change the bullets for itemize and rating marker
% for \cvskill if you want to
\renewcommand{\itemmarker}{{\small\textbullet}}
\renewcommand{\ratingmarker}{\faCircle}
